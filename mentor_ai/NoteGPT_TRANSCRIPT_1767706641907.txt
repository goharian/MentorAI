What is the greatest generation? It's the people that were born around 1910. What's [music] unique about them? History and our lives work in seasons. [music] So, think of it this way. 0 to 21 is springtime. What are the qualities of springtime? Growth is hard or easy. When [music] springtime, it's not hard. You can plant anything it grows in springtime, right? If you start a business in a springtime economy, you think you're a genius. You're just in the right season, right? It's easy

season, right? But every season is followed by a challenging season than an easy season. It's like when the real tough night comes, you get the daylight. You know, it's like if you were God, when you set up that way, it's how we grow. >> 0 to 21 is not the same for all of us. Some of us had to go to work at 7 or 8 years old to take care of our family. Some of us went through physical trauma and so forth. However, you're still not the one who goes to war. You're still having someone feeding you to some

extent. Someone's looking out for you. And it's the place where we get poured into it. education, belief systems. We're learning and we're absorbing like crazy. 0 to 21 is a random number. Some people it's 16 that they really change seasons, but that's the first stage. Now, you go from 22 to 42. That's summertime. That's where you're tested. All studies show people 22 to 42 are the most unhappy in their lifetime usually. And the reason is because you think you've learned everything and you've

been somewhat protected or a lot protected and now you think that you're made of you're invincible. I'm going to be president of the United States. I'm going to be a multi-billionaire. I'm going have a 100 relationships and everybody's going to be happy simultaneously. And then by the time you're 30 or 35, you've had two or three relationships or more and or you got married or you got divorced and you're like and you're not president of the United States and you're not a

billionaire and all of a sudden you're like this is not it. And what you're trying to you're the soldier of society in that season 22 to 40. In fact, if we have a war, you're the one going to war, right? That's who's going to go. Whether you like it or not, you're going, right? If you're in a corporation, you're the soldier. Now, if you grow during that time, if you grow during the spring and the summer and you fight through the hot summer, it's a difficult time. You will

arrive in the fall where you get to reap. 43 to 63 is that reaping time. That's where all the experiences, Cena know that you've been through, good and bad, now you recognize patterns. You understand what's going on. You don't react the same. You know, when you have, if you have multiple kids, the first kid gets an ear infection and you think it's the end of the world in the hospital. By the fourth child, you love them just as much, but you don't react. You go, it's part of this stage. You go handle it,

but there's no upset. Well, the same thing is as you get 43 to 63, you've lived enough life. you have enough relationships, you've had enough life experience, you've built up some skills, that's usually the massive growth reaping time financially, emotionally, and everything. If you grew, if you worked hard in the spring and summer, you reap in the fall. If you didn't, you weep in the fall. You know, you got a challenge. But then the next stage and the stage I would never have known this

and that's why I want to plant the seed since I'm just about turned 65 myself 64 to 84 or 64 to 104 or 64 to 120 which is the oldest living humans somewhere in there is the final stage of winter and in that season and I see it in you brother it's a season where you wake up to realize in the other times you're trying to prove to yourself or others who you are now you know who you are you certainly Like I'd love to help everyone on earth, but I know I'm not the right person for everybody. My style, my

approach is not going to be there, but I'm not trying to make that happen, prove that happen. It's like I used to have these large mission statements change. Now my mission statement, how can I help? >> Right on. >> It's like it's like how can I help? Somebody calls me and they got cancer. Okay, I know I've got a body of knowledge and understanding around health. That's amazing. I interviewed 150 of the best regen doctors in the world. I have finance. Why don't I help?

I interviewed 50 of the best in the world. I know that they're my friends now. I know those patterns. I can help. So it's like it's a different world at that stage. That's where you get to really be a mentor. That's when you get to be a person that can give back. So my view is let's find the beliefs that are holding you back and let's replace them with beliefs that move you forward cuz everybody does what they believe. >> Right on. >> And like by the way you I all human

beings have done things at times they're not proud of. Anybody says says that they didn't is a liar, right? Or they're unconscious. Why'd you do what you did? You can beat yourself up. You did what you believed your choices were at the time. That's why I believe everyone's innocent. So you're going to say that uh you know someone who blows people up is innocent. No, I'm not saying the behavior is innocent. I'm saying they were once a child that was pure and untouched and then somewhere along the

way through a series of events they developed a different belief. It may have been shaped a good deal by their environment. It may have been shaped by horrific circumstances. You can't say it was controlled by the environment completely because I can find you somebody in the same environment who chose differently. >> Our creator has given us one thing. Whatever you call creation or the universe or God, whatever your term is. I prefer God personally, but whatever your view is, there's one thing that's

clear. We have choice. But at this stage of my life, it's like come on, you know, it's like you know who you are. And so now now it's your joy to help other people not have to go through suffering that you went through. I mean, we all should be able to help the next generation. and be able to stand on our shoulders, not have to start over. And so it's like and that becomes more your natural mission. And then towards the end of that stage, if you stay alive long enough, hopefully healthy long

enough, then others tend to look out for you. >> Right on. >> Because you've contributed so much to them. And and and then you die and create room for the next group. You don't experience life. [snorts] You experience only the life you focus on. >> Right on. >> So in this moment right now, you could be totally pissed off. If you want to think about things be pissed off in your own life or what someone's done or something you don't even have to deal with you other people you can be totally

grateful. It depends on what you focus on. That's the cycle of life. Now human beings were transformed by understanding patterns. The most important pattern in humanity that took us from survival being hunter gatherers moving from place to place scarcity was when we recognized seasons. When we recognize seasons, we discovered, wow, I could do the right thing at the wrong time and I get nothing but pain. If everybody does what they believe, >> right on. >> You did what you believed your choices

were at the time. I have to know what season I'm in and apply that to where I am. And if I want to stay here, I got to plant in the spring. I can't expect it's going to show up. Like some people plant like, well, where's the result? Are you new? It takes a while. You got to go through all the seasons. So then you go through the summer and you fight through the hot summer and keep growing. And then you reap in the fall. And oh by the way, while you're reaping, you're not stupid. You save some for the winter. So

when the tough times come, you're able to grow and expand and have a great time with your family. And then the season begins again. And the good news is what follows every winter is spring. What follows the harsh, you know, dark night of the soul is that beautiful new life or morning. What's more important for you to experience in life? the skills to make you have a fulfilled and happy life or the skills, practical skills to have financial security or freedom. In the 60s and 70s, what do you think 81% of

college students said? It's a it's a happy life. What do you think they said in the 80s, '90s, and 2000? >> Give me that bread, brother. >> That's right. It's pragmatic. Yeah. >> So now, what season are we in today? We're the season of history. Would you say it's springtime? Is it summer? Is it fall? Or is it winter? Harsh winter. People have been fearful. They think the world's the same things happened before and nobody said the world's going to.

And now they happen. It's like the whole earth's going to be over. You know, I'm not going to have a kid because in 12 years I've been told, you know, the entire world, you know, uh, you know, environment's going to be crushed. I mean, the level of it's winter now. We're I don't know. I'm not a forecaster, but if you study historians, we'll tell you we're probably 3/4 of the way through it. We're not done. Every winter has great financial challenges

and every winter also has a significant war that reorganizes things. We probably have at least a cyber war with China. We're kind of in it to some extent right now, but something and then people get tired of being upset. They get tired of the fight and get and then peace for a lot of time and things change. You can look at this history over and over. So the ideal is a cocktail between present and future and where when you do touch the past, it's the grateful things of the past. So why I'm telling you this is

the millennial and Z generation and I hear people criticize them. I understand why they might feel that way cuz they think that they've been pampered. They have been. They don't think they have been because they have no other reference. But they didn't do that. They experienced it. But I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that's the next hero generation >> because they know to communicate each other and use technology and what we're facing in the future. They will rise to

be the next heroes. So I have enormous respect for these young people. Even the ones that aren't there yet. I know they're going to get there. They've not been tested. Well, I'll finish the whole thing by saying this. I can give you the history of the world in four phrases. Good times create weak people [music] only. Always. Not because people are weak, but because they don't have to be strong. If you don't lift weights, you're not going to get stronger. As time goes, they're getting weaker.

Right? >> What is weights? It's lifting resistance against something that's really difficult. Right? So, good times create weak people. Weak people create bad times. You know, [music] art for art's sake is the philosophy of the well-fed. You know, it's like no one here has faced they think they've faced challenge. They don't know what a challenge is. So, they're busy worrying about pronouns or what people call them on social media or where it's there and making it life and death. But they will

grow when the challenges expand and they enter that place of leadership and they're about to be there. If good times create weak people, weak people bad times. Bad times create strong people. >> Right on, man. >> And strong people create great times.
